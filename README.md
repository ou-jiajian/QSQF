# QSQF
This is an implementation of the paper "Nonparametric Probabilistic Forecasting for Wind Power Generation using Quadratic Spline Quantile Function and Autoregressive Recurrent Neural Network".

This implementation is mainly based on the TimeSeries repository which can be found in https://github.com/zhykoties/TimeSeries. We deeply thank to the work by Yunkai Zhang, Qiao Jiang and Xueying Ma. We also thank to the GEFCom2014 to provide open source data in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169207016000133#ec000005
